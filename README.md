# Auto-Strike: Source
Easily download and mount content from the Counter-Strike: Source dedicated server distribution in Garry's Mod.

## How it works
This application does not contain any content in itself; rather, it:

1. Downloads and sets up SteamCMD
2. Downloads the Counter-Strike: Source dedicated server
3. Moves the dedicated server content to the Garry's Mod folder
4. Mounts the files in Garry's Mod using [mount.cfg](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Mounting_Content_on_a_DS)
5. Cleans up anything else

## How to use this
Download a release zip in the Downloads section. Extract it, run AutoStrikeSource.exe, and follow the instructions.
